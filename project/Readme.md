The sudoku puzzle is captured via a phone camera and a Convolutional Neural Network performs image processing to detect the 9x9 grid and extract the pre-filled digits. These values are formatted as a partial input grid for the next Artificial Neural Network stage which processes the mathematical sudoku constraints to infer solutions for the missing cells. Specifically, the CNN model digitizes the puzzle, and the grid formulation step shapes the extracted image data into
consumable input for the AI solver model to run constraint-based inferencing algorithms on. The integrated CNN-ANN deep learning architecture provides an end-to-end workflow from capturing the image to predicting the most logically valid digits for the empty cells through the structured sudoku grid, outputting the solved puzzle on the interface.
